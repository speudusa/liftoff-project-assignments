# liftoff-project-assignments

Inspired from my [liftoff portfolio](https://github.com/speudusa/liftoff-assignments/tree/master/P2-Project_Outline) and the [original liftoff assignments](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/liftoff-assignments/tree/master/P2-Project_Outline)

### Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.
