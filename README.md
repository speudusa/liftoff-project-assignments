# Liftoff Project Assignment DEMO

This repo will hold your work on your project.
  
You will use this repository in tandem with Canvas. All of your grades will be recorded in Canvas, but you will submit your work through this GitHub repository.

We are making you use GitHub for two important reasons:
  - You will get more practice with GitHub
  - You will be able to share the story of your project. 

The team leader of your group should fork a copy of this repo and share their fork with the rest of the team.
