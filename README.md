# Liftoff Project Assignment DEMO

Inspired from my [liftoff portfolio](https://github.com/speudusa/liftoff-assignments/tree/master/P2-Project_Outline) and the [original liftoff assignments](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/liftoff-assignments/tree/master/P2-Project_Outline)

## Group changes

As a team, create a project outline.
One team member should create the Project Repo (not the team leader).  remaining team members clone/fork and contribute.
