## Liftoff Assignments

This repository is the base repo for all assignments in LaunchCode's Liftoff course.

## Getting Started

**Team Leader**

- If you are enrolled in the Liftoff program, fork this repository and then clone it to your computer. 
- Share the link with your fellow teammates.

**ALL Team Members** 

Update the project's [*main* README](https://github.com/speudusa/liftoff-project-assignments) in the following ways:
- Make it all about your team and your project
- Share your team name on the page
- Add links to your GitHub accounts & your roles on the project
- Add a link to your [project's Google Site page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WTNot5c-l7B2QsxtZT5MjYF_HmsFzwday6QVNf3BFEw/edit#bookmark=id.woyx0gas0yf7). 

**Note about your Google Site:**

> We are asking you to create it.  It will be very empty and that is okay.  
> Anyone on the team can host it for your team, it doesn't have to be the team leader.  
> You will build this out as your project grows.  You will use it for your presentation tool at the end of Liftoff.


Have a look through the directories. 
Each one corresponds to an assignment, and the README will provide additional details on the tasks to be carried out.

You will complete these Project Assignments as a team.
